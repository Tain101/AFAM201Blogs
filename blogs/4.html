The civil rights movement is one of the most important human, social, and political rights movements, not only in the United States; but arguably in the world. Based on your reading of Simon Hall (2007), Jack Dougherty (1998), the textbook, and your own research, create a blog post that provides a critical discussion of the causes; and social, political, and economic consequences of the civil rights movement in the United States.

    a single unified movement dominated by a few elite leaders."'

    local support for Black teachersoften recognized as pillars of their communities-sometimes outweighed or
    counterbalanced support for the national NAACP desegregation campaign.'

    job/teaching -> more important than segregation

    "I would like to make myself very clear,77interrupted Urban League
    director Kelley, clarifying his position in this racially charged debate. He
    did not favor the Black training school solution, but acknowledged the political realities. "I feel the most ideal, democratic way is that anyone, if they
    are qualified, should be allowed to teach anywhere. But if we can7t teach
    anywhere, then for goodness sake, let us teach where it is said we might
    teach... We are not asking for teachers to teach only in the Fourth and
    Ninth Street Schools, but if you will not tolerate them teaching anywhere
    else, then let them teach there.77"
