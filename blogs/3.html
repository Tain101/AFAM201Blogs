The transatlantic slave trade is one of the most important events in the history of the world. Between 1650 and 1860, approximately 10 to 15 million enslaved people were brought from Africa to the Americas.  Based on the textbook, reading assignments, and the Schomburg Center for Black Culture, New York Public Library archives provided in the link below, discuss the social, economic, and cultural consequences of slavery for both Africa and the African diaspora in the Americas. Make sure as well to provide basic information about:

1. the number of enslaved people brought from West Africa to the United States.
2. the conditions enslaved people experienced during the middle passage (the Atlantic Ocean journey from West Africa to the shores of the American South).
3. the human and economic cost of slavery for Africa and  people of African descent.
4. any other relevant information you find in the course your research.

    Blog #3: Transatlantic Slavery
</h1>
<p>
	Throughout almost all of history slavery has existed in some form or another. But as the demand for labor in the newly conquored America, a new surge of slavery rose. In the past slaves were very much considered human beings, and were often captured in war or performing a service to repay a debt in the family.
</p>
<p>
	For several reasons, the demand for labor was met with the capture and dehuminization of Africans. Tens of millions of Africans were captured and shipped to America, Europe and other European colonies. With the every growing number of slaves, control and oppression needed to rise also. Public whippings, hangings, and other forms of torture were used to control the Africans. As this sort of sadistic oppression became more necessary to maintain control, the view of Africans as humans needed to decrease. Treating Africans as a product became  more common, and thus easier to accept.
</p>
<p>
	When shipping a product, comfort, sanitation, and overall wellbeing aren't taken into account. Packing as many people into these ships became the priority. Sickness, murder, and suicide were all common.
