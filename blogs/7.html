Blog Post 7: Racial Politics

Since the election of President Obama in 2008, there has been considerable discussion about the extent to which his presidency changed the racial politics of the United States.
Some argue that Obama’s presidency led to a lessening of the significance of race, while other suggest; if anything, it led to a more racially intense political environment.
Base on your own research; create a blog post that articulates your understanding of the nature and dynamics of racial politics as a result of Obama’s presidency.

     Blog Post 7: Racial Politics
</h1>
<p>
    Barack Obama winning presidency in 2008 is undoubtedly the most prominent example of racial politics in the United States. There was a lot of apprehension and worry from both Black and non-Black citizens, and of course a lot of hope.
</p>
<p>
    Being racially Black, but culturally White left Obama is a unique position. Some Black Americans felt Obama could not accurately represent the Black American community because he did not have the same background as other Black Americans.<sup><a href="#footer">[1]</a></sup> Others felt Obama growing up in America with Black skin, is enough for him to understand the Black American experience.<sup><a href="#footer">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    The result of Obama's victory in the presidential campaign caused a change in racial politics as well. The most obvious is that a precedent has been set; because we have had a Black president, the issue of race is less important in politics. Steele also argues that this will cause the removal of "White guilt", or that Obama's presidency will be used as a justification or payment for racism in the United States.<sup><a href="#footer">[2]</a></sup>
