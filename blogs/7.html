Blog Post 7: Racial Politics

Since the election of President Obama in 2008, there has been considerable discussion about the extent to which his presidency changed the racial politics of the United States.
Some argue that Obama’s presidency led to a lessening of the significance of race, while other suggest; if anything, it led to a more racially intense political environment.
Base on your own research; create a blog post that articulates your understanding of the nature and dynamics of racial politics as a result of Obama’s presidency.

     Blog Post 7: Racial Politics
</h1>
<p>
    Barack Obama winning presidency in 2008 is undoubtedly the most prominent example of racial politics in the United States. There was a lot of apprehension and worry from both Black and non-Black citizens, and of course a lot of hope.
</p>
<p>
    Being racially Black, but culturally White, left Obama is a unique position. Some Black Americans felt Obama could not accurately represent the Black American community because he did not have the same background as other Black Americans.<sup><a href="#footer">[2]</a></sup>

    What is Black Lives Matter?
</h2>
<p>
    To put it simply, it is an activist movement trying raise awareness to the systematic racisms of the United States criminal justice system. There is a trend of Black people being treated worse by poliece officers, and those police officers not being punished for their racism.
</p>
<p>
    In 2013, three women (Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi) started the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in response to the aquittal of George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Trayvon Martin. From there, the hashtag was used to raise awareness of several deaths of Black americans caused by police. Along with this, a majority of those responsible for these deaths, were often aquitted or given an unacceptably light sentence.<a href="#footer">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    It feels unfair to pick out specific examples of police violence against Black americans, but to give an idea of why so many people are outraged, it is necessary.

    Alton Sterling was shot by police officers on July 5, 2016. The call was that a man was threatening and waving a handgun. The police arrived, tased Sterling, had two officers pin him to the ground, and then shot him six times.<a href="#footer">[3]</a></sup>

<p>
    Philando Castile was shot by a police officer on July 6, 2016. He was pulled over as part of a traffic stop, with his girlfriend and her four year old daughter. He notifies the police officer that he has a conciled weapon and permit to carry one. He was shot seven times.<a href="#footer">[4]</a></sup>

    Youtube channel ViHart does a very good job summarizing and explaining #BlackLivesMatter, and I would very much recommend viewing her video <a href="http://vihart.com/context-for-black-lives-matter/">here</a>.
    A more comprehensive list of important shootings, protests and events can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter#Timeline_of_notable_U.S._events_and_demonstrations">here</a>.

    What is the contriversy?
</h2>
<p>
    There are two main contentions with #BlackLivesMatter, first being that focusing on Black lives instead of All lives ignores a large group of people who are victims of police violence. The second contention is that the supporters are ignoring the violence and danger that police officers face. Each of these has started a hashtag, but neither has gained much attention as their own cause.
</p>
<p>
    #AllLivesMatter is a tag for a group of supporters who feel that focusing on Black victims of police violence is ignoring victims who aren't Black. There is often conflict between this group and #BlackLivesMatter. Whether or not focusing on Black lives is helpful to other races, or is even racist, is the main point of argument.<a href="#footer">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    #BlueLivesMatter is a tag for a group of supporters of police officers. Their goal is to raise awareness of police who have been killed, and the dangers police face. The conflict here is whether or not supporting police officers and bringing attention to those who were killed, supports the institutional racism that is in our police system.<a href="#footer">[6]</a></sup>
