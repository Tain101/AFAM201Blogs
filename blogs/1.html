    <h1>Blog #1: African American Studies</h1>
    <p>
        During the first two weeks of this course we have been reading essays from various professors and other intellectuals. The overall message or theme of these papers has been: A case for the legitimacy and need of African American Studies. After reading these papers, most should be able to see reasons why African American Studies as a major of study might be worthwhile.
    </p>
    <h2>Defining African American Studies</h2>

    <p>
        In order to give a valid assessment of anything, both the author and reader have to have the same definitions of the topic at hand. I believe Perry A Hall defines African American Studies best, <div class="quote">&ldquo;[African American Studies] is presented as one of several forms of cultural reflection &hellip; accompanied by insights that detail the historical and social context as well as the sociodemographic and macroeconomic changes associated with the great urban migration of Blacks&hellip;&rdquo;</div><sup><a href="#footer">[1]</a></sup> The distinction between African American Studies and other, less multidisciplinary fields, is its use of several contexts. Molefi Kete Asante provides us with another major distincion <div class="quote">&ldquo;Black Studies was not the mere aggregation of courses about our experiences but had to be courses taught from what we called at the time &ldquo;the black perspective.&rdquo;&rdquo;</div><sup><a href="#footer">[2]</a></sup> To put into my own words, African American Studies is a collective effort to provide complete and accurate insight into Black history, in any and every field that is relevant.

            The subject of this painting is Black, but is the perspective?

    <h2>The argument for</h2>

    <p>
        If you are reading this, there is a good chance you are either a proffessor or student of this course, so I hope the arguments for should be easy to agree with.
    </p>
    <p>
        The clearest benefit of African American Studies is that the perspective of Blacks is almost entirely absent in the United States education system. This distincion, in my opinion, is what makes this field greater than the sum of its parts. From a purely objective standpoint, adding a new perspective as a method of gathering information is a huge benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is indesputable that in the United States, history, literature, and any field that can be told from a European perspective, is. Once we understand this, it is clear that our collection of knowledge as a whole is far less complete than it could be.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other property of African American Studies is that it does not limit or section scholars or research into a given field. This is good for two reasons. First, any student of any field can contribute, the field is welcome to any person who can contribute to the study. Second, it allows subjects of study to be constructed from multiple angles. Allowing historians, literary analasists, sociologists, and others to collectively create the record of a given subject, providing a broader and deeper understanding of that subject.
    </p>
    <h2>The argument against</h2>
    <p>
        The hardest thing for me to accept is the proposed scope of the major. Perry A. Hall writes: <div class="quote">&ldquo;African American studies programs represent multidisciplinary approaches in which disciplinary boundaries intact &mdash; scholars trained in history, humanities, or social science fields apply their particular disciplinary approaches to some piece of the body of knowledge in relative isolation from the whole.&rdquo;</div><sup><a href="#footer">[1]</a></sup> As stated above, the unique thing that AFAM Studies is trying to do is take several different fields of study, and unify them under the Black perspective. If keeping these areas of study separate, is also refining them and creating an overall better way to acrue knowledge, having the same collection of students and proffessors spread amongst the existing majors would give a better result.
    </p>
    <p class="center">Does having such an open ended area of study allow scholars more freedom, or cause them to lose focus?
    </p>
    <p>
        Fortunately, we don&rsquo;t have to rely on my instintcs about the major at this moment to ultimately decide the major&rsquo;s fate. The most straighforward way to answer this question in my opinion is to look at how the major has done so far. African American Studies is a unique approach to an understanding of broad academic disciplines from a specific perspective. Hopefully as time goes on, we will see the value in this style, and how we learn and research will be overall improved.
