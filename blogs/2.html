    Blog # 2: Diversity in Africa
</h1>
<p>
    This week we read about some of the pre-European societies in Africa, the vast language diversity of Mozambique, and heard from a group of proffessors about their views on African diversity. We also read a paper criticizing a book called Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad, though this was not directly about diversity.
</p>
<p>
	I enjoyed listening to the panel of proffessors the most of this weeks assignments, getting a variety of first hand experiences I think helped show some of the bigger misconceptions the average Iowa State student might have about Africa.
</p>
<p>
	Talking about Africa's diversity implies grouping Africa as a continent into a single entitiy. After this weeks reading, it seems impossible to generalize the continent that much. Not only is Africa massive, and there is great geographical diversity; but the countries themselves seem much more diverse than what would be typical in other parts of the world.

		Robinson’s (1993: 52–5)
		treatment of linguistic diversity seems to be quite insightful. He defines high
		linguistic diversity as ‘¼ a situation where no more than fifty per cent of the
		population speak the same language’. And he adds that ‘a ranking of degree of
		linguistic diversity should not be based on the absolute number of languages in
		a country, but rather on the percentage of the population speaking any single
		language’

		25/58 countries are liquistically diverse

		Emakhuwa constitutes a significant numerical minority nationally, because no other language comes close to it in size, or is widely spoken in
		at least three out of the country’s 11 Provinces (Figure 1).

		p 9/49 for general area of languages

		Portuguese is the only medium of government-controlled national communication in the areas of administration and education, and has also been
		referred to as the symbol of national unity.

		current estimation of 40% of the total population
		who can speak and understand the official language.

    &lt;cultural/ethnic&gt;

	Al-Quraan (the Koran) is taught and also
	memorised in many schools and neighbourhood locations in the northern region
	of the country, especially along the coast, where the population is essentially
	Muslim.

	There is a fairly high number of Catholic
	and Protestant churches and missionary schools countrywide.

	in a sociolinguistic survey of western Zambezia, report
	that despite the non-existence of biblical schools or seminaries in western
	Zambezia, a great many people study the Bible either in Portuguese or Cinyanja
	through distance learning theological education (Educação Teológica por Extensão)

	English is a lingua franca in
	each of the states bordering Mozambique and a 	common language for inter-communication among 	them. Both Portuguese and English are the two 	official
	languages of the Southern African Development Community
