Blog #5: Segregation and Discrimination



Racial segregation is one of the most important factors that structure and organize social inequalities and access to educational and economic resources.
Based on this week’s assigned articles, “Racial Residential Segregation: A Fundamental Cause of Racial Disparities in Health,” “Majority African American Schools and Social Injustice: The Influence of De Facto Segregation on Academic Achievement,” your textbook, and your own research,

create a blog that provides a critical discussion of the ways in which
racial segregation informs differences in educational achievement between
urban and suburban America, health outcomes, and quality of life in general.

Your comments must be based on information from the reading assignments and your research, not your opinion.
Please consult with this link to see the extent of black-white segregation in different metropolitan areas and overtime: http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/dis/census/segregation2010.html, Click on the first link which says: Black-White Segregation Indices for Metro Areas.

    Blog #5: Segregation and Discrimination
</h1>
<p>
    Residential segregation is a major cause for many of the socioeconomic disadvantages African Americans face today. What I read this week talked about the differences between low socioeconomic status(SES), and high SES. Health, job opportunities, and education are all affected by residential segregation.
</p>
<h2>
    Health
</h2>
<p>
    The correlation between SES and health was the most intuitive for me. Less money means fewer doctor visits, trouble paying for medicine or medical care, etc. In the image below, we can easily see the correlation between SES and health.
</p>

<p>
    You can also see there is a correlation between race and health, so we conclude that SES isn't the only cause for this difference in health.
</p>
<p>
    Along with the purely financial side of living in a lower income area, there are also come less obvious reasons why lower income can mean lower health. It's shown that low income areas are more heavily targeted by sellers of alcohol and tabacco products.<sup><a href="#footer">[2]</a></sup> We know these products are often used as coping mechanisms, or escapes from stressors that would be caused by living in a low income area.
</p>
<h2>
    Job Opportunities
</h2>
<p>
    Businesses often do not want to build in low SES communities, and there is little incentive to push them that direction. This creates a negative feedback loop of jobs moving out of low SES areas, creating more poverity and inequality throughout the country. Businesses leaving an area leads to fewer jobs, more crime, and reinforces the negative stereotypes of low SES areas.
</p>
<h2>
    Education
</h2>
<p>
    Education is one of the most important socionomic aspects of an area. The way to lift a low SES area out of poverty, is to provide better education. Unfortunately we know education faces many of the same issues Job Opportunities do.
    <div class="quote">
        &ldquo;Compared to schools in middle-class areas, segregated schools have lower average test scores, fewer students in advanced placement courses, more limited curricula, less qualified teachers, less access to serious academic counseling, fewer connections with colleges and employers, more deteriorated buildings, higher levels of teen pregnancy, and higher dropout rates.&rdquo;
    </div>
    <sup><a href="#footer">[3]</a></sup>
    Because education is correlated with SES, we get another negative feedback loop. Poorly funded schools means worse education, which leads to worse jobs and less money in the community.
